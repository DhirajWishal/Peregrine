# Peregrine

Peregrine is a tilt-rotor/ tilt-wing VTOL controller designed to use an ESP32 board. This uses two rotors along with 4 servos (one for each wing, one for the elevator and the other for the rudder) to control the pitch, roll and yaw controls.

The controller is compatible with Arduino although I haven't tested it. Arduino Uno or any other board which utilizes the ATmega328P chip might not have the required IO pins to connect everything together. So using a more advanced Arduino board might work.
